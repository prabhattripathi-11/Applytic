main.py

Entry point for the Applytic MS2 Resume Matching Service.

This file's only job is to construct the FastAPI application, wire in
logging and the resume-matching router, and expose two trivial
operational endpoints (root and health). No parsing, matching, or
workflow logic lives here — that all already exists in
routes/resume_routes.py, workflow/workflow.py, and the nodes/utils
modules underneath it. This file just assembles those pieces into a
runnable app.

Run with:
    uvicorn main:app --reload
